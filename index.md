Overview</h2>

Many people on campus struggle with finding facilities they are satisfied with. Well-known restrooms tend to become crowded and will sometimes run out of resources like toilet paper and soap. Water fountain filters are sometimes left unchanged for too long and will become contaminated. Popular study spaces can also become overcrowded and loud, while many "secret" spots are not utilized. Our project, Rate My Facilities, will be a resource that students can use to find facilities near them, rate their quality, and post comments about them.
